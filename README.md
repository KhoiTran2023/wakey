#wakey

Welcome to wakey! This app was designed to be the next game-changer in drivers' safety. We know we are all tired, whether you're finishing a night shift or coming back home from school. By using facial recognition to detect fatigue in our drivers, we can warn them of their likelihood to cause an accident on the road, and even others around them that have the app.

Welcome to wakey! This code is based on algorithms from Driver-State-Detection and Yawn-Detection source code
Inspired by MTCNN-based research, this version uses DLib and OpenCV.
